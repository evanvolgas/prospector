"""
Prospector Risk Calculator - High-Performance Portfolio Risk Analysis Engine.

This is the main entry point for the Prospector real-time risk calculation system.
It processes portfolio updates from Kafka, calculates comprehensive risk metrics,
and caches results in Redis for API consumption.

Architecture Overview:
    - Stream Processing: Bytewax-based pipeline for high-throughput processing
    - Risk Engine: Behavioral finance model with 20-100 risk scoring
    - Data Flow: Kafka (input) -> Risk Processor -> Redis (cache)
    - Performance: Capable of processing 79,000+ messages/second

Key Features:
    - Real-time portfolio risk assessment
    - Individual security analysis (50+ supported stocks)
    - Behavioral risk adjustments based on investor profile
    - Dollar-based risk metrics (Value at Risk)
    - Correlation-based portfolio analysis

For detailed architecture information, see ARCHITECTURE.md

    Main entry point for the Prospector risk calculation engine.
    
    This function orchestrates the entire risk calculation pipeline:
    
    1. Initializes Redis connection for result caching
    2. Creates RiskProcessor instance with behavioral risk model
    3. Builds Bytewax dataflow pipeline with Kafka integration
    4. Launches continuous stream processing
    
    The pipeline consumes from 'portfolio-updates-v2' Kafka topic and
    publishes results to Redis for API consumption.
    
    Usage:
        Run directly: python risk_calculator.py
        With workers: python risk_calculator.py -w 4
        
    Environment Requirements:
        - Kafka broker running on localhost:9092
        - Redis server running on localhost:6379
        - 'portfolio-updates-v2' topic created in Kafka
